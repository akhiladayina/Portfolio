           <p>I have done my training on Artificial Intelligence domain in an  AIMERS organization, 
            where i have done small projects that improve my intrest on new technologies. 
            This internship is completely hands-on experience where i built visual question and answering model, 
            data visualizations using power bi, object detection using YOLO-V8, Text Summarization, voice Bot.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="p">
            <h5>Data Security, cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking</h5>
            <p>I have done my 2-months at Supraja Technologies, Vijayawada,where i have gone through real time attacks, 
                hackings this internship is completely pratical based i.e., 
                20% Theoretical knowledgr and 80% Practical based knowledge.

                <h3>Object Detection by using YOLO-V8</h3>
                <p>This model helps us to find vehicles and different objects in a traffic cameras 
                    in the real time applications using computer vision ,
                    this uses python programming to implement this, in this model first we have to train the
                     model using training and validation sets with a dataset
                     later we can test with test dataset. this gives 90% accuracy in detection.

                <h3>Visual Question and Answering</h3>
                <p>In this visual question and answering model it answers the questions related to the given picture. 
                    we can give any picture and it will give the result to question related to that picture. It uses computer vision, 
                    Natural language processing, Open CV, python to analyze picture and answer the questions.</p>

                <h3>Voice Bot</h3>
                <p>In this bot it recognizes the voice commands and response to the commands by both voice and returns on the screen.
                    It uses NLTK processing, and python, tensorflow, and speech recognization to processing the voice to respond.
